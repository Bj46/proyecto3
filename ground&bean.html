    <h2>The Best Coffee</h2>
    <dl>
      <dt>What does ground coffee mean?</dt>
      <dd>Ground coffee is what brewed coffee is made of. It's made up of ground coffee beans, much like flour is made of wheat and maize is made of corn. You use ground coffee like you would use a tea bag: add hot water to it, let it steep for a few minutes, then strain and drink</dd>
      
      <dt>How to make it?</dt>
      <dd>Pour a medium size spoon of Yaucono into boiling water per each regular cup of coffee. Percolate the content and serve.</dd>
      <dt>Whole Bean is Better</dt>
      <dd>Whole bean coffee often costs more than ground coffee for one simple reason: it's a better coffee. Whole bean coffees tend to come from better crops and be more recently roasted than pre-ground selections. In short, whole bean coffee makes a better cup of coffee — and the difference is worth paying for.</dd>
      <dt>What Yaucono represent?</dt>
      <dd>Yaucono is an iconic brand which represents both our coffee culture and tradition. Yaucono Coffee Whole Bean are hand picked beans, toasted to a perfect roast and processed to an ultra fine grind resulting in its exquisite taste so we can enjoy a delicious cup of coffee.</dd>
      <dt>Where is Yaucono coffee from?</dt>
      <dd>Café Yaucono, established in 1896, is Puerto Rico's most iconic coffee brand. It has a rich creme, strong aroma and an excellent medium roast.</dd>
